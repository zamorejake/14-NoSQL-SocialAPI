Using my new found mongo skills this project required me to setup a full mongo backend with mongoose to store data related to a social network api. This includes users, names, emails, thoughts, and friends.

## Installation

`npm i` and then `node index` to run the api. You will need to use either Insomnia or Thunder Client to make requests.

## Usage

Here is my demo video, in it I am mainly making calls to http://localhost:3001/api/users and http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts.
